# Semester 1 Programming Course Work

## Overview

Welcome to the repository for Semester 1 Programming Course Work! This repository contains all the Java code developed during the semester as part of the programming module. The focus of the coursework was on applying object-oriented programming concepts such as encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism, and method overriding.

## Structure

The repository is organized based on the questions provided during the semester. Each question corresponds to a Java program that implements the specified scenario using object-oriented principles. The use of classes, interfaces, and other OOP features is evident in the code.

## Usage

Feel free to explore the code for each question to understand the application of OOP concepts. If you are a fellow student or anyone interested in learning Java and OOP, you may find the code examples helpful for reference and learning.
